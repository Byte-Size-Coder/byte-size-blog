I am now 6 years into the industry, and I have been apart of various teams all from different sizes, experience, and projects. I have been apart of start ups, and large companies. I thought it would be nice to share some of the knowledge and experience I have had, and put it into little tips for anyone new in the industry. I hope this gives you insight moving forward in your career.

## You don't need to have everything figured out right away.

I did not know this was going to be my career until I was 22. So DO NOT STRESS! take the time you need to figure out what will make you wake up everyday excited to start it. I live and breath code so the motivation always keeps me going happily. It is also perfectly fine if you decide this is not what you want to do. There is plenty of time to pivot. Make sure you are happy.

## Practical over theory.

This may be different for others. But expecially in programming, it is important to get your hands into code as soon as possible! It is important to learn the theory and understand how things operate, but until you get in there and actually experience how things are run, it will be harder to grasp. Alot of my knowledge game from just fooling around making stupid little things.

3. To build off my second point... Its more about what you HAVE DONE, not exactly your grades or what you know off the top of your head. Most interviews or job descriptions will ask for your "github" account or equivalent. Or ask you to show something you have done. They want to know that you have applied your knowedlge to the test with actual tangible things
